## 🧠 Overview  

**Plex-Earth** is a powerful geospatial extension that connects CAD software with real-world geographic data. It enables engineers, architects, and surveyors to bring maps, imagery, terrain models, and coordinate systems directly into their design environment with high accuracy.

The platform simplifies working with GIS data by allowing users to stream satellite imagery, import elevation models, and manage coordinate reference systems without leaving their CAD workspace. This results in better context, improved precision, and faster decision-making during project development.

Designed for Windows-based professional workflows, Plex.Earth integrates smoothly into industry-standard CAD tools and supports both small-scale projects and large infrastructure designs.
